# gl8
A CHIP-8 Emulator written in Python using ModernGL that truly gives that retro feel.

### Why another CHIP-8 Emulator?

It's one of the most fun things to do. Frankly, I did this in 3-4 hours as an excercise because I wanted to.

### What's so special about it?

It's in Python, it's a one file program, it uses only two libraries: pygame and moderngl. All the font data,
audio data, shaders is in this one file. It's nice and compact. And unlike all other CHIP-8 emulators, this
one *truly* captures the feel of an 8-bit system with its flashy effects and monitor burn in effect.

### *Wait, burn in? Really?*

I'll let you be the judge.

### Any issues?

Well, of course, it fails a lot of tests especially the QUIRKS and the FLAGS tests. But it runs nearly every
game I've ran on it (BRIX, TETRIS, and a bunch of other demos) just fine. I don't think we have to worry much
about it.
